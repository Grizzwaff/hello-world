HI! My name is Josh.  I just finished my Associate's in Computer Science at Renton Technical College
I am a bit older and have a lot working and life experience.  I can learn how to code anything you want me too, plus have some skills you can't teach! I plan to bring my knowledge to the job be as efficient and helpful as possible.
